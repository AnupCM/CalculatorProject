# CalculatorProject
# Calculators work best when a human provides equations for the computer to solve. 
# Weâ€™ll start writing our program at the point where the human enters the numbers that they would like the computer to work with.
# Here you will see three functions you can customize how you want for your requirements.
# First you need to setup the python in your local machine aka(desktop, laptop).
# Make sure python is installed correctly by using python --version command in the terminal of your system.
# Set up Virtual Environment by using the venv command in a new directory
# Create python file and write code into it.
# For division operation you will get ZeroDivisionError for number divided by zero.
# You can use try catch to get rid of that error.
